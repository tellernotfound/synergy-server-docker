# WORK IN PROGRESS!!

This is a Docker container to help you get started with hosting your own Synergy
This Docker container has been tested and will work on the following OS:

* Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
* Windows 10,11
* MacOS (including Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3).

This container has also been tested and will work on both `x64` and `ARM64` based CPU architecture.

## How to use

Keep in mind that you'll need to change the [environment variables](#environment-variables).

### Docker Compose

This repository includes an example [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file you can use to set up your server.

```yml
services:
   synergy:
      image: tellernotfound/synergy-server-docker:latest
      restart: unless-stopped
      container_name: synergy-server
      stop_grace_period: 30s # Set to however long you are willing to wait for the container to gracefully stop
      ports:
        - 8211:8211/udp
        - 27015:27015/udp
        # - 8212:8212/tcp  # Port for REST API if REST_API_ENABLED: true
      environment:
         PUID: 1000
         PGID: 1000
         PORT: 8211 # Optional but recommended
         PLAYERS: 16 # Optional but recommended
         SERVER_PASSWORD: "worldofpals" # Optional but recommended
         MULTITHREADING: true
         RCON_ENABLED: true
         RCON_PORT: 25575
         TZ: "UTC"
         ADMIN_PASSWORD: "adminPasswordHere"
         COMMUNITY: false  # Enable this if you want your server to show up in the community servers tab, USE WITH SERVER_PASSWORD!
         SERVER_NAME: "synergy-server-docker by Thijs van Loef"
         SERVER_DESCRIPTION: "synergy-server-docker by Thijs van Loef"
         ALLOW_CONNECT_PLATFORM: "Steam" # Defaults to "Steam" if not set, set this to "Xbox" if you want to host a server for Xbox players. CROSSPLAY BETWEEN XBOX-STEAM IS NOT YET SUPPORTED
      volumes:
         - ./synergy:/synergy/
```

As an alternative, you can copy the [.env.example](.env.example) file to a new file called **.env** file.
Modify it to your needs, check out the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section to check the correct
values. Modify your [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to this:

```yml
services:
   synergy:
      image: tellernotfound/synergy-server-docker:latest
      restart: unless-stopped
      container_name: synergy-server
      stop_grace_period: 30s # Set to however long you are willing to wait for the container to gracefully stop
      ports:
        - 8211:8211/udp
        - 27015:27015/udp
        # - 8212:8212/tcp  # Port for REST API if REST_API_ENABLED: true
      env_file:
         -  .env
      volumes:
         - ./synergy:/synergy/
```

### Docker Run

Change every <> to your own configuration

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name synergy-server \
    -p 8211:8211/udp \
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -v ./synergy:/synergy/ \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e PORT=8211 \
    -e PLAYERS=16 \
    -e MULTITHREADING=true \
    -e RCON_ENABLED=true \
    -e RCON_PORT=25575 \
    -e TZ=UTC \
    -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="adminPasswordHere" \
    -e SERVER_PASSWORD="worldofpals" \
    -e COMMUNITY=false \
    -e SERVER_NAME="synergy-server-docker by Thijs van Loef" \
    -e SERVER_DESCRIPTION="synergy-server-docker by Thijs van Loef" \
    -e ALLOW_CONNECT_PLATFORM="Steam" \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --stop-timeout 30 \
    tellernotfound/synergy-server-docker:latest
```

As an alternative, you can copy the [.env.example](.env.example) file to a new file called **.env** file.
Modify it to your needs, check out the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section to check the
correct values. Change your docker run command to this:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name synergy-server \
    -p 8211:8211/udp \
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -v ./synergy:/synergy/ \
    --env-file .env \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --stop-timeout 30 \
    tellernotfound/synergy-server-docker:latest
```

### Kubernetes

All files you will need to deploy this container to kubernetes are located in the [k8s folder](k8s/).

Follow the steps in the [README.md here](k8s/readme.md) to deploy it.

### Running without root

This is only for advanced users

It is possible to run this container and
[override the default user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user) which is root in this image.

Because you are specifiying the user and group `PUID` and `PGID` are ignored.

If you want to find your UID: `id -u`
If you want to find your GID: `id -g`

You must set user to `NUMBERICAL_UID:NUMBERICAL_GID`

Below we assume your UID is 1000 and your GID is 1001

* In docker run add `--user 1000:1001 \` above the last line.
* In docker compose add `user: 1000:1001` above ports.

If you wish to run it with a different UID/GID than your own you will need to change the ownership of the directory that
is being bind: `chown UID:GID synergy/`
or by changing the permissions for all other: `chmod o=rwx synergy/`

### Environment variables

You can use the following values to change the settings of the server on boot.
It is highly recommended you set the following environment values before starting the server:

* PLAYERS
* PORT
* PUID
* PGID

### ARM64-exclusive environment variables

ARM64 hosts can use the following variables to tweak their server setup. This includes
known relevant Box64 configurations one can modify for better server stability/performance.

For the Box64 configurations, please see the their official documentation for more info.

> [!TIP]
> Set `ARM64_DEVICE` to the most appropriate setting for your device. `generic` is expected
> to work on all devices but better stability can be found with specifying your device.
> For more specific device compatibility, create an issue on the
> [base image repo](https://github.com/sonroyaalmerol/steamcmd-arm64).

### Game Ports

| Port  | Info                |
|-------|---------------------|
| 8211  | Game Port (UDP)     |
| 8212  | REST API Port (TCP) |
| 27015 | Query Port (UDP)    |
| 25575 | RCON Port (TCP)     |

## Using RCON

RCON is enabled by default for the synergy-server-docker image.
Opening the RCON CLI is quite easy:

```bash
docker exec -it synergy-server rcon-cli "<command> <value>"
```

For example, you can broadcast a message to everyone in the server with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it synergy-server rcon-cli "Broadcast Hello everyone"
```

This will open a CLI that uses RCON to write commands to the synergy Server.

### List of server commands

| Command                          | Info                                                |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Shutdown {Seconds} {MessageText} | The server is shut down after the number of Seconds |
| DoExit                           | Force stop the server.                              |

## Using REST API

REST API is not enabled by default.
If used, please set REST_API_ENABLED to true.

docker-compose.override.yml

```yaml
services:
  synergy:
    environment:
      REST_API_ENABLED: true
```

The synergy-server-docker image provides rcon-cli as well as rest-cli.

```bash
$ docker exec -it synergy-server rest-cli
Usage: rest-cli <api> [options]
api:
  announce <json> ... announce message.
  ban <json>      ... ban player.
  info            ... show server informations.
  kick <json>     ... kick player.
  metrics         ... show server metrics.
  players         ... show online players.
  save            ... save the world.
  settings        ... show server settings.
  shutdown <json> ... shutdown server.
  stop            ... force stop server.
  unban <json>    ... unban player.
options:
  '{...}'         ... json.
  -               ... json from stdin.
  -h, --help      ... help.
```

For example, you can broadcast a message to everyone in the server with the following command:

CLI parameter style:

```bash
docker exec -i synergy-server rest-cli announce "Broadcast Hello everyone"
```

JSON parameter style:

```bash
docker exec -i synergy-server rest-cli announce '{"message":"Broadcast Hello everyone"}'
```

JSON pipe style:

```bash
echo '{"message":"Broadcast Hello everyone"}' | docker exec -i synergy-server rest-cli announce -
```

rest-cli allows you to call REST APIs directly without exposing ports outside the container.

| unban {SteamID}                  | Unban player.               |
| save                             | Save the world.             |
| shutdown {Seconds} {MessageText} | Shutdown the server         |
| stop                             | Force stop the server.      |

## Creating a backup

To create a backup of the game's save at the current point in time, use the command:

```bash
docker exec synergy-server backup
```

This will create a backup at `/synergy/backups/`

The server will run a save before the backup if rcon is enabled.

## Restore from a backup

To restore from a backup, use the command:

```bash
docker exec -it synergy-server restore
```

The `RCON_ENABLED` environment variable must be set to `true` to use this command.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If docker restart is not set to policy `always` or `unless-stopped` then the server will shutdown and will need to be
> manually restarted.
>
> The example docker run command and docker compose file in [How to Use](#how-to-use) already uses the needed policy

## Manually restore from a backup

Locate the backup you want to restore in `/synergy/backups/` and decompress it.
Need to stop the server before task.

```bash
docker compose down
```

Delete the old saved data folder located at `synergy/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/<old_hash_value>`.

Copy the contents of the newly decompressed saved data folder `Saved/SaveGames/0/<new_hash_value>` to `synergy/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/<new_hash_value>`.

Replace the DedicatedServerName inside `synergy/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/GameUserSettings.ini` with the new folder name.

```ini
DedicatedServerName=<new_hash_value>  # Replace it with your folder name.
```

Restart the game. (If you are using Docker Compose)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuring Automatic Backups with Cron

The server is automatically backed up everynight at midnight according to the timezone set with TZ

Set BACKUP_ENABLED enable or disable automatic backups (Default is enabled)

BACKUP_CRON_EXPRESSION is a cron expression, in a Cron-Expression you define an interval for when to run jobs.

> [!TIP]
> This image uses Supercronic for crons
> see [supercronic](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic#crontab-format)
> or
> [Crontab Generator](https://crontab-generator.org).

Set BACKUP_CRON_EXPRESSION to change the default schedule.
Example Usage: If BACKUP_CRON_EXPRESSION to `0 2 * * *`, the backup script will run every day at 2:00 AM.

## Configuring Automatic Updates with Cron

To be able to use automatic Updates with this Server the following environment variables **have** to be set to `true`:

* RCON_ENABLED
* UPDATE_ON_BOOT

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If docker restart is not set to policy `always` or `unless-stopped` then the server will shutdown and will need to be
> manually restarted.
>
> The example docker run command and docker compose file in [How to Use](#how-to-use) already use the needed policy

Set AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED enable or disable automatic updates (Default is disabled)

AUTO_UPDATE_CRON_EXPRESSION is a cron expression, in a Cron-Expression you define an interval for when to run jobs.

## Editing Server Settings

### With Environment Variables

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> These Environment Variables/Settings are subject to change since the game is still in beta.
> Check out the [official webpage for the supported parameters.](https://tech.synergygame.com/optimize-game-balance)

Converting server settings to environment variables follow the same principles (with some exceptions):

* all capital letters
* split words by inserting an underscore
* remove the single letter if the setting starts with one (like 'b')

For example:

* Difficulty -> DIFFICULTY
* PalSpawnNumRate -> PAL_SPAWN_NUM_RATE
* bIsPvP -> IS_PVP

### Manually

When the server starts, a `synergySettings.ini` file will be created in the following location: `<mount_folder>/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/synergySettings.ini`

Please keep in mind that the ENV variables will always overwrite the changes made to `synergySettings.ini`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes can only be made to `synergySettings.ini` while the server is off.
>
> Any changes made while the server is live will be overwritten when the server stops.

For a more detailed list of server settings go to: [synergy Wiki](https://synergy.wiki.gg/wiki/synergySettings.ini)

## Using discord webhooks

1. Generate a webhook url for your discord server in your discord's server settings.

2. Set the environment variable with the unique token at the end of the discord webhook url example: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcde`

send discord messages with docker run:

```sh
-e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcde" \
-e DISCORD_PRE_UPDATE_BOOT_MESSAGE="Server is updating..." \
```

send discord messages with docker compose:

```yaml
- DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcde
- DISCORD_PRE_UPDATE_BOOT_MESSAGE=Server is updating...
```

## Locking Specific Game Version

>[!WARNING]
>Downgrading to a lower game version is possible, but it is unknown what impact it will have on existing saves.
>
>**Please do so at your own risk!**

If **TARGET_MANIFEST_ID** environment variable is set, will lock server version to specific manifest.
The manifest corresponds to the release date/update versions. Manifests can be found using SteamCMD or websites like [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/depot/2394012/manifests/).
